#+TITLE: Including Serial and Disruption Tests
#+PROPERTY: header-args:sql-mode :product postgres :noweb yes :comments off

* Purpose
  The dataset we use doesn't include serial and disruption tests, but there is another dataset that does.  What does it look like if we add that to our results?
* Process

  We load up ou8r data sets using `select * from load_audit_events`
  this assumes a bucket and job and if none given, we take from sig-release-master-blocking's latest job.
  does this mean we could just put in a different bucket and...it just works?

  Current releases
  #+begin_src sql-mode
  select release, source from audit_event group by release, source;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_SRC example
   release |                                                    source

  #+end_SRC

  Now i'll load in the bucket we want, located at ~ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-latest~

  #+begin_src sql-mode
select * from load_audit_events();
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_SRC example
   load_audit_events
  -------------------
   it worked
  (1 row)

  #+end_SRC

  hey it works! but what does it look like?
** num tests
   #+begin_src sql-mode
  select count(distinct endpoint) filter(where test is not null) from audit_event;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_SRC example
    count
   -------
      286
   (1 row)

   #+end_SRC
