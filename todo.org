#+TITLE: TODO's

A place to capture todo's quickly as they come up

* Inbox
** TODO Remove printing the url's in the audit event
   It creates a lot of noise in the build and I am not sure if it is useful

** TODO Improve success statement for load_audit_events
   Right now it just says 'it worked' would be better to say 'audit events for 1.XX from bucket/job loaded'
** TODO Add build log announcements for each migration
   Could it be something like 'CREATE EXTENSIONS'  "EXTENSIONS CREATED" and "Create open api table" and "open api table defined and commented"
   it'd help to see where we are at in the build.  I think we could do it with cheeky select statements
